# Recommender Systems

## Overview
Recommender Systems are algorithms designed to suggest relevant items to users based on patterns in data. They analyze past interactions, preferences, and behaviors to predict what items (products, content, services) a user might be interested in.

## Objective
The main goal of recommender systems is to filter through large amounts of data to predict a user's preference for items they haven't yet interacted with, thereby providing personalized suggestions that enhance user experience and engagement.

## Key Concepts

1. **Content-Based Filtering**:
   - Uses item features/attributes
   - Analyzes item similarities
   - Creates user profiles based on preferences
   - Recommends similar items to those liked before

2. **Collaborative Filtering**:
   - User-Based: Find similar users
   - Item-Based: Find similar items
   - Matrix Factorization techniques
   - Based on user-item interactions

3. **Hybrid Systems**:
   - Combines multiple approaches
   - Balances different recommendation strategies
   - Leverages advantages of each method
   - More robust recommendations

4. **Rating Systems**:
   - Explicit ratings (e.g., 1-5 stars)
   - Implicit feedback (clicks, views, purchases)
   - Binary interactions (like/dislike)
   - Time-based decay
