# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Overview
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional form while preserving as much variance as possible. It works by finding the principal components (directions of maximum variance) in the data and projecting the data onto these components.

## Objective
The main goal of PCA is to reduce the dimensionality of data while retaining important patterns and relationships. This is achieved by transforming the original features into a new set of uncorrelated variables (principal components) ordered by the amount of variance they explain in the data.

## Key Concepts

1. **Principal Components**:
   - Orthogonal vectors representing directions of maximum variance
   - Ordered by amount of variance explained
   - Linear combinations of original features
   - First PC captures most variance, second PC captures second most, etc.

2. **Variance Explained**:
   - Proportion of total variance captured by each component
   - Cumulative variance helps determine number of components to keep
   - Usually aim for 80-95% of total variance

3. **Standardization**:
   - Required preprocessing step
   - Centers data at origin (mean = 0)
   - Scales features to unit variance
   - Ensures all features contribute equally

4. **Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues**:
   - Eigenvectors determine direction of principal components
   - Eigenvalues indicate amount of variance explained
   - Used to rank importance of components

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
1. Reduces dimensionality effectively
2. Removes multicollinearity
3. Reduces noise in data
4. Improves computational efficiency
5. Helps visualize high-dimensional data

### Disadvantages
1. May lose some information
2. Transformed features lose interpretability
3. Assumes linear relationships
4. Sensitive to outliers
5. May not capture non-linear patterns

## Steps to Implement PCA

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values
   - Scale/standardize features
   - Remove outliers if necessary

2. **PCA Configuration**:
   - Choose number of components
   - Set parameters (if any)
   - Define variance threshold

3. **Model Application**:
   - Fit PCA to training data
   - Transform data to reduced dimensions
   - Analyze variance explained

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Explained variance ratio
   - Cumulative explained variance
   - Scree plot analysis
   - Component loadings

## Python Implementation
Here's a basic example using scikit-learn:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
X = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Standardize features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Create and fit PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_scaled)

# Analyze results
print("Explained variance ratio:", pca.explained_variance_ratio_)
print("Cumulative variance ratio:", np.cumsum(pca.explained_variance_ratio_))

# Plot scree plot
plt.plot(range(1, len(pca.explained_variance_ratio_) + 1),
         pca.explained_variance_ratio_, 'bo-')
plt.xlabel('Principal Component')
plt.ylabel('Explained Variance Ratio')
plt.title('Scree Plot')
plt.show()
