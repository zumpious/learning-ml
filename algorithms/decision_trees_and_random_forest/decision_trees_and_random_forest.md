# Decision Trees and Random Forest

## Overview
Decision Trees and Random Forests are versatile machine learning algorithms that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. Decision Trees make predictions by learning decision rules from features, while Random Forests combine multiple decision trees to produce more robust and accurate predictions.

---

## Objective
The goal of Decision Trees is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. Random Forests extend this by creating multiple decision trees and combining their predictions to reduce overfitting and improve accuracy.

## Key Concepts

### Decision Trees
1. **Node Types**:
   - Root Node: Starting point of the tree
   - Internal Nodes: Decision points based on features
   - Leaf Nodes: Final predictions

2. **Splitting Criteria**:
   - Gini Impurity (for classification)
   - Entropy (for classification)
   - Mean Squared Error (for regression)

3. **Tree Parameters**:
   - Maximum Depth
   - Minimum Samples per Split
   - Minimum Samples per Leaf

### Random Forest
1. **Key Features**:
   - Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)
   - Random Feature Selection
   - Ensemble Learning

2. **Components**:
   - Multiple Decision Trees
   - Voting/Averaging Mechanism
   - Out-of-Bag (OOB) Error Estimation

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
1. Easy to understand and interpret (especially single decision trees)
2. Handles both numerical and categorical data
3. Requires minimal data preprocessing
4. Can capture non-linear relationships
5. Provides feature importance rankings

### Disadvantages
1. Individual trees can overfit the data
2. Single trees can be unstable
3. Random Forests can be computationally intensive
4. Less interpretable than single decision trees
5. May struggle with highly imbalanced datasets

## Steps to Implement

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Split data into training and testing sets

2. **Model Configuration**:
   - Set hyperparameters (max_depth, min_samples_split, etc.)
   - For Random Forest: number of trees, max features

3. **Training**:
   - Fit the model to training data
   - For Random Forest: train multiple trees in parallel

4. **Prediction Process**:
   - Navigate through decision rules
   - For Random Forest: aggregate predictions from all trees

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Classification metrics:
     - Accuracy
     - Precision
     - Recall
     - F1-score
   - Regression metrics:
     - MSE
     - RMSE
     - R-squared

## Python Implementation
Here's a basic example using scikit-learn:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Sample data
X = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]])
y = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1])

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

# Decision Tree
dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3)
dt.fit(X_train, y_train)
dt_pred = dt.predict(X_test)

# Random Forest
rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=3)
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)
rf_pred = rf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate models
print("Decision Tree Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, dt_pred))
print("Random Forest Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, rf_pred))
print("\nRandom Forest Feature Importance:", rf.feature_importances_)
